\section{Meeting Report}
This week we met in the library for a couple hours. The first part of our meeting was a briefly review of our project in order to confirm the details in the design of user interface and figure out how the database connect to our system. 
Then, we moved to the “user stories” part. At the very beginning, we could only list 9 user stories in our project. Later, we found some of the user stories we made were too general, so we divide these general user stories into many sub-stories which were much more specific and detailed. After finishing all the user stories, we sorted these stories by priority and decide which parts would we do on next week. 

Next week, we will start to work on the coding stuff. In the first implementation assignment, we are planning to work on the “Login Page” and “Sports Page”. We divided our first implementation into 3 parts which are HTML, CSS \& DATABASE. Ziyu and Cooper is going to work on the HTML. Jordan will work on the CSS to design our website. Michael and Ryan will work on the database. And the goal for this assignment is to run our “Login Page” and “Sports Page” successfully. 

Our customers were able to meet with group. One of our customers was my friend who was a student major in Marketing, I briefly introduced our project to her and explained our user stories. Except some of the technical information like the server side, she could mostly catch our points and clearly know how to work on this project. I think this is really a good new to our team, because users can feel comfortable of using our project, even they don’t have any background of CS. There was another customer who is a graduate student and majors in CS in OSU. He said the purpose and the design of the project was clear, not that complicated and he also mentioned the sever side was a critical part in this project. 
According to the responses of these two customers, I think it is reasonable for our project, which include the user with CS background and non-CS background.
